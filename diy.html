            <h2>CREATE AN EVENT</h2>
            <p>At Huset you can create your own events and festivals – on your own or with counseling from Husets’ administration and users. We work with three approaches of co-creation:</p>



            <h2>CO-CREATION </h2>
            <p>Huset-KBHs’ users initiate plenty of new projects, events and festivals and are always looking for new collaborators and possibilities. So, if you feel the need to contribute and co-create, don’t hesitate to contact us. We are all about co-creation – it is our experience that unique things will happen when you involve more people.</p>



            <h2>COUNSELING </h2>
            <p>If you have an awesome project, event or a festival but need a venue and/or collaborators to help you create the project please contact us. We can help with counseling, planning, settlement etc. We are all about co-creation – it is our experience that unique things can happen when you involve more people.</p>



            <h2>DIY</h2>
            <p>If you have an awesome project or a festival that are missing a venue you are more than welcome to contact us. We have several possibilities for rent, bar guarantees etc. Sometimes we can be collaborators and make the project even cooler! We are all about co-creation – It is our experience that unique things can happen when you involve more people.</p>
